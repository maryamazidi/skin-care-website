            <h2>Meet our skincare specialist Brittney!</h2>
            <p>Hey there, SkinTalks readers! My name is Brittney, and I am a skincare specialist at Korean Skincare. I am a passionate and dedicated graduate cosmetologist. I enjoyed doing this, but I was very curious about how the skin care world worked behind the scenes. That's when I found Korean Skincare! In this blog you will get to know me better, I will answer some personal related skin care questions but first, let me introduce something new on our website!</p>
            <h3>Personal Skincare Advice!</h3>
            <p>We will do 1:1 video calls with everyone who want to learn more about skincare and what is best for their skin type and concern. Do you want to know more about it? Visit our Personal Skincare Advice page here and schedule an appointment! Now let's start to answer some questions!</p>
            <h3>How did you first get into skincare?</h3>
            <p>I myself used to suffer a lot from acne and I could not find a solution for this. This is why I was searching for an answer by myself. I soon realised that my breakouts wouldn’t just go away over time. This started my journey for better skin, where I spent hours reading articles and watching videos that explained everything about the skin and all kinds of ingredients. I soon found out that I actually found this very interesting, and so I started studying it! I get super excited about skincare and love guiding others on their journey to their best skin possible!</p>
            <h3>What is your favourite product of Korean Skincare?</h3>
            <p>That's a hard one! I love a lot of Korean skincare products! However, if I have to choose, it's The TIA'M My Signature C Source or the ANUA Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner. I really can't decide between these two products, I’m sorry, okay!</p>
            <h3>What would you advise to new skincare users?</h3>
            <p>Start simple! If you are new to skincare, I would advise you not to create a 10-step routine right away. Your skin needs time to get used to new products, if you apply too many new ingredients it is possible that your skin may react to this (redness, small bumps etc.)</p>
            <h3>Final word</h3>
            <p>Join me in this journey to achieve healthy, glowy skin. Go ahead, pamper your skin, enjoy the process, and carry your newfound radiance with pride. Here's to healthy, happy skin that mirrors the self-love and care you've poured into it.</p>
