            <h2>THE FULL KOREAN SKIN CARE ROUTINE</h2>
            <p>For those new to Korean Skincare, the famous 10-Step Routine can seem daunting and intimidating. But fear not! The KS Team is here to walk you through every step. </p>
            <h3>1.Oil cleanser</h3>
            <p>The K-Beauty double cleanse serves as a foundation of the Korean skin care routine. These cleansers help dissolve impurities, especially oil-based ones from make-up, sunscreen, and excess sebum. An oil cleanser hydrates and softens the skin where other traditional make-up removers often dry out or irritate the skin. An oil-based cleanser helps keep your skin healthy and balanced.

            <h3>2.Water Based Cleanser</h3>
            <p>It takes a second cleanser to completely remove all impurities from the face - which leads us to our Step 2 - the Water Based Cleanser! Water based cleansers remove any residue that your oil cleanser did not remove as well as help remove any remaining residue from the oil cleanser. They typically come in gel and foam textures.</p>

            <h3>3.Exfoliator</h3>
            <p>Exfoliators, whether chemical or physical, aid in cleaning pores and removing dead skin cells, resulting in brighter and smoother skin. Depending on the strength of the exfoliator, it is typically recommended that you only use it once a week. Certain chemical exfoliants are diluted enough to be used daily. However, it's always important to start once a week, and if need be, build up slowly.</p>

            <h3>4.Toner</h3>
            <p>Toners help remove any remaining residue while also repairing your skin's barrier and balancing its pH level. Toners also help the skin absorb the products that come after it more effectively.Unlike traditional Western skincare toners, Korean skincare toners are not astringent or contain drying alcohol contents. Korean toners are generally more hydrating and less irritating to the skin. They are typically applied by cotton pad and/or patting into the skin.</p>

            <h3>5.Essence</h3>
            <p>One of the Korean Skincare routine's defining qualities. Essences are water-based treatments that are lightweight and packed with moisturizing, protecting, and anti-aging ingredients. They help keep skin hydrated, healthy, and balanced. In combination with cleansing and toning, they help enhance the effectiveness of the treatment products applied afterwards.</p>
